## Abstract
Bacterial antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is increasing concern. AMR occurs due to random mutations and can be acquired through transmissible plasmids. Selective pressures, such as overuse in farming, increase the rate of AMR. This study analysed trends in AMR for 16 Gram-negative oxidase-positive bacteria. Firstly, Genome Comparator was used to find which ResFinder AMR genes were present in each bacterial species. This was then combined with metadata from PubMLST and BIGSdb Pasteur. Next, the data were analysed using R. Out of the 17 antimicrobial classes investigated, beta-lactams had the highest resistance. Also, Pseudomonas aeruginosa had the widest range of resistance across antimicrobial classes. The continent and country with the highest percentage of AMR was Asia (25.9%) and Uzbekistan (35.3%), respectively. Additionally, environmental sources (62.5%) had the highest percentage of AMR. Overall, AMR of Gram-negative oxidase-positive bacteria is increasing, and new antibiotics may be required to tackle this problem in future.
